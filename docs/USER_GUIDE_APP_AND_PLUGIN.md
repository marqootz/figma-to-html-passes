# User Guides: App + Plugin

Two guides cover the Figma to HTML desktop app and the Figma to HTML plugin:

| Audience | Guide | Contents |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **End users** (non-developers) | [**End User Guide**](USER_GUIDE_END_USER.md) | Run the app, load the plugin, connect to Google Drive. No dev setup. |
| **Developers / admins** | [**Developer Guide**](USER_GUIDE_DEVELOPER.md) | Google OAuth (PKCE), build the app and plugin, pre-fill Client ID, distribute. |

Give **end users** the [End User Guide](USER_GUIDE_END_USER.md) and the built app + plugin folder. Use the [Developer Guide](USER_GUIDE_DEVELOPER.md) to build and distribute.
